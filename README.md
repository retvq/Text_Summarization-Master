# Text Summarization using Frequency and Sinusoidal Weighting 

## Overview
This project implements multiple text summarization techniques based on word frequency and sinusoidal sentence weighting. It analyzes a body of text and extracts the most informative sentences using different statistical and positional strategies.

## Techniques Implemented
1. **Fractal Summary**: Uses paragraph and sentence-wise frequency distributions to determine sentence importance.
2. **Word Frequency Summary**: Ranks sentences based on frequency of significant words.
3. **Sin Frequency Summary**: Applies a sinusoidal transformation based on sentence position to adjust importance.
4. **Sin Word Frequency Summary**: Applies sinusoidal weighting to word frequencies and ranks sentences accordingly.

## File Structure
- `main.py`: Main file containing summarization implementations.
- `news.txt`: Sample input text for testing summarizers.
- `Text_Summarization_Research_Report.docx`: Full research-style documentation.
- `Text_Summarization_Research_Report_Updated.docx`: Final updated report with contributor details.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python libraries needed to run the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-directory>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download necessary NLTK resources:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

## Usage

To run the summarization process:

```bash
python summarizer_ui.py
```

The program will display summaries generated by each technique.
